# Introduction
This repository tries to answer some of the questions that might pop-up in someone's mind when starting to learn Data Science. We basically use Data Science to get answers to our questions about the field of Data Science. 

# Installation
All the libraries used here are already available in the Anaconda distribution of python except pandas-profiling(used for generating profile reports). But the Jupyter Notebook itself takes care of downloading the required package and hence no external installation is required.

# Questions to be answered by the data
1. Which language should one start learning for coding in Data Science?
2. What sources do people use for learning Data Science?
3. What platforms do people use for learning Data Science?
4. What are the most popular ML frameworks according to experience in industry?
5. What are the most used IDE's according to experience in Data Science?

# Data Used
The data from the [Kaggle ML and DS Survey 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data) is used here.
